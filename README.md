# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview

The purpose of this analysis was to help Bobby figure out the number of retiring
employees by title and then identify which employees are eligibile to participate in 
the mentorship program. 


## Results 

Provide a bulleted list with four major points from the two analysis deliverables.
Use images as support where needed.

- 72,458 people are retiriing, out of the 300,024 people employed. There are about 24% 
of the employed staff retiring.
ADD COUNT TABLE HERE

- There are 50,842 employees in a senior position retiring. In the future, maybe they 
can have the senior staff employees, retiring or not, get trained on how to become in 
the mentorship program.

- Of the 72,458 people retiring, only 1,549 are eligible for the mentorship program.


## Summary

Provide high-level responses to the following questions, then provide two additional
queries or tables that may provide more insight into the upcoming 'silver tsunami'.

- When the 'silver tsunami' begins, 72,458 people will be retiriing, with 
50,842 people retiring in a senior position.
	
- There are 1,549 people that are qualified to train their replacement or 
following employees. That means only about 2% of people retiring are qualified to
mentor their fellow employees. To me, that is not near enough people ready to
mentor the next generation of employees. If they maybe trained people that have 
several years of experience and are not retiring, it would help take some of the
load off of the retiring mentors.
